### Meet & Greet on Slack
That’s where the OpenMetadata enthusiasts are;
apart from [GitHub](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata), of course.

Catch up with all the discussions and queries on the growing world of metadata. Know what other users are looking for and how OpenMetadata contributes to make their lives easier.

Learn, engage, and get going with your organization’s needs!

[Join our Slack](https://slack.open-metadata.org/)

### Monthly Meetups
Join us **every month** over Zoom to learn about OpenMetadata’s progress. We are on a fast-paced release schedule. So every meeting, we have new releases and features to showcase.

Come, join in, and share your feedback and questions.
